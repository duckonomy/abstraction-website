      <description>Changes in 2019-2020 This year, we have tried to change how we do leadership in Abstraction. Of course, the core leadership to sustain the club will remain. However, we wanted a more modular non-core leadership for particular events. These one-off leaders will be able to use Abstraction&amp;rsquo;s system to lead events of their interest. By making this change, we want to increase student activity in Abstraction and empower students by giving the opportunity to lead and plan events.</description>

      <description>Hi there My name is Radek and I&amp;rsquo;m the author of this theme. I made it to help you present your ideas easier.
We all know how hard is to start something on the web, especially these days. You need to prepare a bunch of stuff, configure them and when that’s done — create the content.
This theme is pretty basic and covers all of the essentials. All you have to do is start typing!</description>

      <description>What Is Abstraction? Abstraction is Calvin University&amp;rsquo;s Computer Science Club.
New Abstraction 2019-2020 In recent years, there has been an effort to change Abstraction&amp;rsquo;s activity base from gaming and miscellaneous activities to more Computer Science related activities. This year, we will dedicate our activities to truly empower computing students.
